# React Boilerplate

Yet another starting point for creating React apps. This boilerplate uses React Router, Webpack, HMR, PostCSS & Express.

Heavily inspired by [react-kickstart](https://github.com/vesparny/react-kickstart).

### Development
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will start an express app at http://localhost:8000.


### Production Build
```
npm run build
npm run build:start
```
This will create a production build and will start a server at http://localhost:8000/


### Deployment
Install the Heroku toolbelt.
```
heroku create myapp
git push heroku master
```
